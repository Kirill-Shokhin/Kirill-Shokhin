Hello! I am a computer vision engineer with 3 years experience. 

I solve both technical recognition tasks, usually aimed at optimizing production, and tasks for determining the position of the camera and objects necessary for overlaying AR graphics.

Researching, engineering and optimization of Deep Learning pipelines, bringing them into real time mode is my main current activity and my hobby. I love everything about understanding the computer of our reality through imagery and using modern graphics accelerators to do that. 

I have a strong physics and mathematics background, as well as an inner drive to extract the irrational grain from logical structures, refining the algorithm to a mathematically perfect limit. 
My global goal is to acquire unique abilities in data and computational science.

### Models
I can not just run these models, I can solve the problem with any combination of them by pre-training the models on the necessary datasets, then extracting and rewriting the code for inference to get rid of unnecessary dependencies and make the primary acceleration, and finally, optimizing the final pipeline of inference by completely transferring all weighty calculations to the graphic card using onnx+trt transforming any pipeline into real-time mode.
