Hello! I am a computer vision engineer. 

Researching, engineering and optimization of augmented reality pipelines, bringing them into real time mode is my main current activity and my hobby. I love everything about understanding the computer of our reality through imagery and using modern graphics accelerators to do that. 

I have a strong physics and mathematics background, as well as an inner drive to extract the irrational grain from logical structures, refining the algorithm to a mathematically perfect limit. 
My global goal is to acquire unique abilities in data and computational science.
